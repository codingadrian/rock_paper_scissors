# Rock Paper Scissors

This is my first project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Motivation

I am working towards becoming a full stack developver.

## Requirements

Create a Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript.

* It has to have a function called computerPlay, that will randomly return "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors".
* The function must play a single round. It should take two parameters: playerSelection and computer Selection; and then return a string that declares the winner of the round: "You lose! Paper beats rock!"
  * The function needs to be case insensitive.
  * The results must be "returned".
* There must be a NEW function called game(). Create a 5 round game, keeping scores and reporting the winner/looser at the end.
  * console.log() to display each round's winner.
  * Use prompt() to get input from the user.
